        <h2>What is Publico?</h2>
        <p>
            Publico is the official online reservation system of the Municipality of Orani, 
            developed to provide residents with a modern and reliable way of accessing 
            government-owned facilities. Through this platform, the community can book 
            basketball courts, function halls, meeting rooms, and other public spaces 
            without the need to visit the municipal hall personally, reducing long queues 
            and saving valuable time.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
        <p>
            The system was created with the goal of making local government services more 
            transparent, accessible, and efficient. By digitizing the reservation process, 
            Publico helps ensure fairness in scheduling, improves the management of community 
            resources, and strengthens the connection between the municipal government and 
            the people it serves. It represents Oraniâ€™s commitment to modernization and 
            better service delivery for every resident.
